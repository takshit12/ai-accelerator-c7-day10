**ReAct stands for Reasoning + Acting.**

It's just a loop:
```
Reason  → which tool should I use?
Act     → call the tool
Reason  → what does the result mean?
Act     → call another tool if needed, or give final answer
```

---

**In your code specifically, the ReAct agent is:**

The thing that manages the back and forth between GPT-4o and your tools. It's the middleman.
```
You → ReAct Agent → GPT-4o (call 1) → calculator runs → GPT-4o (call 2) → You
